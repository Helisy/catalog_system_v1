# 🛠️ Project Setup

Before starting the app, make sure to create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

DB_HOST=<your_database_host>
DB_USER=<your_database_user>
DB_PASS=<your_database_password>
DB_DB=<your_database_name>

HOST_IP=<your_server_ip>
PORT=<your_preferred_port>

Replace each placeholder (<...>) with your actual configuration values.


# 🚀 How to Run

Open your terminal (CMD, PowerShell, bash, etc.) in the root folder of the project and run:
npm install
npm start

Your app should now be up and running! 🎉
